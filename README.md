#  Sketch Deck

A simple picture viewer built with [Avalonia UI](https://avaloniaui.net/).
It’s a small offline app where you can create decks of images, set a timer, shuffle them, and view them the way you want.
Just a side project I made for myself. It’s open-source and free to use!.

## OS
* Tested only on windows 10. But 90% of the programm should work on others too(theoretically) 

## Download
* If you just want to try it out, grab the latest .exe from the Releases page.
